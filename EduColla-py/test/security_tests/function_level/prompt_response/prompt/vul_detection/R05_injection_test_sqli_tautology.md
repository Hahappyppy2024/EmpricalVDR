You are a web application security auditor (vulnerability detector).

### 1) Task
Diagnose why the SECURITY TEST below fails. Use ONLY the test and the provided code snippets. Do NOT write any code diff in this step. Output a minimal, concrete repair plan for the next step.



### 2) Function Feature (security property)
SQL injection resistance: the posts search API must treat keyword as 
data (not SQL), so a tautology payload (e.g., ' OR 1=1 --) must not broaden 
the result set or expose sensitive database details.

### 3) Failed Security Test

from .._helpers import api_login, api_get

# ============================================================
# API (JSON) - SQL Injection (stronger oracles)
# ============================================================


def _get_posts_json(client, course_id, keyword):
    q = urllib.parse.quote(keyword, safe="")
    rv = api_get(
        client,
        f"/api/courses/{course_id}/posts?keyword={q}",
        expected_status=(200, 400, 401, 403, 404),
    )
    if rv.status_code == 200 and rv.mimetype == "application/json":
        return rv.get_json()
    return None

    auth.login("teacher", "password")
    course_id = sample_course

    # Baseline: a keyword that should return empty or very small results
    baseline = _get_posts_json(client, course_id, "zzzz_no_such_keyword_zzzz")
    injected = _get_posts_json(client, course_id, "' OR 1=1 --")

    # If API not implemented / not returning JSON, we can't judge -> skip
    if baseline is None or injected is None:
        import pytest
        pytest.skip("Posts search API not implemented or not returning JSON; cannot assert SQLi effect")

    # Stronger oracle: injection should NOT increase results compared to baseline
    # (If your app legitimately returns all posts for empty/unknown keyword, adjust this oracle.)
    assert isinstance(baseline, list) and isinstance(injected, list)
    assert len(injected) <= len(baseline), "Possible SQLi: tautology payload expanded result set"

    # Still keep leakage checks
    import urllib.parse

    payload = "' OR 1=1 --"
    q = urllib.parse.quote(payload, safe="")

    rv2 = client.get(f"/api/courses/{course_id}/posts?keyword={q}")
    body = rv2.data or b""
    assert b"password_hash" not in body
    assert b"sqlite_master" not in body


### 4) Relevant Application Code (ONLY what is pasted exists)
{CODE_SNIPPETS: routes + middleware + controller (+ repo/view if needed)}

### 5) Output Requirements (STRICT)
Your response MUST contain exactly the following 7 sections, in this exact order, with the exact headings.
- Do NOT add extra sections.
- Do NOT omit any section.
- Do NOT output any code diff.

[1] VulnType
Choose exactly ONE label from: R01 R02 R03 R04 R05 R06 R07 R08 R09 R10
Format:
VulnType: Rxx

[2] TestMapping
2–4 bullets mapping: (expected by test) -> (observed) -> (code cause).
Each bullet MUST reference a concrete code point shown (route/middleware/function name).
Format:
TestMapping:
- ...
- ...

[3] RootCause
2–4 bullets pointing to the exact missing/incorrect check and where it should be enforced (route/middleware/controller).
Format:
RootCause:
- ...
- ...

[4] RepairPlan
3–7 bullets. EACH bullet MUST include BOTH:
- Target: <file/snippet name + function/route>
- Change: <exact edit>
Format:
RepairPlan:
- Target: ... | Change: ...
- Target: ... | Change: ...
- Target: ... | Change: ...

[5] ReliabilityClaim
Exactly ONE sentence explaining why this diagnosis is supported by the given test + code (no speculation).
Format:
ReliabilityClaim: ...

[6] RegressionRisks
1–3 bullets listing what might break and what should be rechecked later.
Format:
RegressionRisks:
- ...
- ...

[7] SelfCheck (YES/NO + Score: + evidence)
Format:
SelfCheck:
- PlanComplete: YES/NO | Score: 0/1 | Evidence: "..."
- GroundedTestMapping: YES/NO | Score: 0/1 | Evidence: "..."

Constraints:
- Do NOT invent filenames, tests, or endpoints beyond what is shown.
- Keep the plan minimal and localized.
